"""Research agent prompts for planning and synthesis."""

RESEARCH_PLANNING_PROMPT = """You are a research planning agent. Create a comprehensive research plan for the given query.

Available tools:
- wikipedia: Search Wikipedia for encyclopedic knowledge
- arxiv: Search ArXiv for research papers and academic content
- web_search: Search the web for current information
- python_repl: Execute Python code for calculations and data analysis

User Query: {query}

Create a step-by-step research plan that:
1. Breaks down the query into specific research questions
2. Identifies which tools to use for each question
3. Determines the order of operations
4. Plans for synthesis of findings

IMPORTANT: 
- For queries about research papers, ALWAYS use arxiv tool
- For queries about datasets, ALWAYS use web_search tool
- Use multiple tools to get comprehensive coverage
- Be specific in your search queries

Output a plan in JSON format like this:
{{
    "plan": [
        {{
            "step": 1,
            "action": "Search for recent papers on the topic",
            "tool": "arxiv",
            "query": "specific search query here"
        }},
        {{
            "step": 2,
            "action": "Find relevant datasets",
            "tool": "web_search",
            "query": "specific dataset search query"
        }}
    ]
}}"""

RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """You are synthesizing research findings into a comprehensive response.

Original Query: {query}

Research Findings:
{findings}

Create a well-structured, comprehensive response that:
1. Directly answers the user's query
2. Integrates information from all sources
3. Highlights key insights and conclusions
4. Acknowledges any limitations or gaps in the research
5. Provides proper context and explanations

Be thorough but clear and well-organized."""

RESEARCH_ITERATION_PROMPT = """Based on the current research progress, determine if more investigation is needed.

Query: {query}
Steps completed: {completed_steps}
Findings so far: {findings}
Remaining plan: {remaining_plan}

Decide whether to:
1. Continue with the remaining plan
2. Modify the plan based on findings
3. Conclude the research and synthesize results

Consider if the findings adequately address the query."""
